## About
This is my submission for the Landing Page project, part of The Odin Project! This project was a perfect way for me to demonstrate to myself that I have built a solid foundation of web design so far in my studies. This project uses images from Unsplash and it was built with HTML and CSS. 

# What I Learned
This project was super useful in learning/practicing flexbox and its various tools. Before I came into The Odin Project, I didn't have a strong grasp on this technology, but now, I am able to create sites like this in no time with lots of flexibility!
